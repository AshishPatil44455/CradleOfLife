Description : There is a dramatic difference in survival of premature babies depending on
where they are born. More than 90% of extremely premature babies born in low-income
areas die within the first few days of life, yet less than 10% of extremely premature babies
die in high-income areas. To overcome this situation we are creating a crowdfunding
website partnering with NGO, to install Neonatal intensive Care Unit (NICU) in
government hospitals of unprivileged areas. This aspect makes it accessible to aÂ wider
audience
